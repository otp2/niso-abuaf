# Niso Abuaf Portfolio Website

This repository contains the content files for rebuilding the professional portfolio website for **Niso Abuaf** - Wall Street Professor, Economist, Strategist, Banker, and Professor.

## Project Overview

We are rebuilding a professional portfolio website for Dr. Niso Abuaf to showcase his extensive experience, publications, teaching, and market insights. The content has been extracted and formatted as markdown files for reference, while the actual website will be built with Next.js and React components.

## Reference Documentation

The following markdown files in the `docs` directory contain reference content for different sections of the website. These files are for planning purposes only and will not be directly processed by the application:

### `academic-publications.md`
Contains a comprehensive list of Dr. Abuaf's academic publications, including titles, publication dates, and brief descriptions. Each publication entry includes links to the full PDF documents.

### `commercial-publications.md`
Lists Dr. Abuaf's commercial publications with titles and publication dates, organized chronologically with links to full PDF documents.

## Context

Dr. Niso Abuaf is a highly accomplished financial professional with:

- 35+ years of Wall Street experience
- Leadership roles at Credit Suisse, Salomon Brothers/Citi, and J.P. Morgan Chase
- Advisory work with blue-chip corporations and sovereign entities
- Academic positions at Pace University and previously at NYU Stern School of Business
- Multiple degrees including a PhD in Financial Economics from the University of Chicago
- Fluency in multiple languages including French, Spanish, and Turkish
- Extensive publications in corporate finance, global macroeconomics, and derivatives

This content represents Dr. Abuaf's professional portfolio, which we are structuring to create a modern, accessible website that effectively showcases his expertise and accomplishments.

## Technical Information

This project will be built using:
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Shadcn UI**: A collection of reusable components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS
- **Framer Motion**: A production-ready motion library for React to create fluid animations (if needed)

### Development Approach
The website will be built with React components containing the content directly. The markdown files in the `/docs` directory serve as reference material only and will not be processed by the application. This approach allows for complete design control and optimal performance.

### Brand Identity

The website uses a sophisticated color palette with teal/aqua primary colors (#007E87, #00575E) complemented by warm gold accents (#D4AF37). The design aims to convey academic credibility, financial expertise, and modern digital sophistication.

Typography uses Source Serif Pro for headings (to convey academic authority) and Inter for body text (for readability and modern feel).

Currently, the repository contains reference documentation and branding guidelines. The full Next.js/React implementation will be added in future updates.

## Next Steps

1. Set up a Next.js project structure
2. Design and implement React components with the content from reference files
3. Create a responsive layout
4. Implement navigation between different sections
5. Add PDF viewing capabilities for linked documents
6. Deploy the website to a hosting platform
