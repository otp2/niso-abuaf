# The Financial Strategy Group (FSG)
## Products and Services, 2018

### Background

FSG was created at Salomon Brothers in the early 1980s for assisting the Firm's Investment Banking Clients on empirical finance issues such as optimal capital structure and cost of capital, drivers of credit ratings and debt capacity, maturity and forex structure of liabilities, valuation of complex securities including M&A related hybrids and executive stock options, new product development, "unusual and complex" projects, econometric analyses, and to address topics de jour by publishing relevant articles. Over the years, the Group's alumni have moved around Wall Street to startup or to participate in similar groups at banks such as Barclays, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan Chase, and UBS, among others. 

FSG's activities have evolved over time to reflect new research findings and techniques in Empirical Corporate Finance, Behavioral Finance, and Contracting Theory. Moreover, in a small firm such as Ramirez and Co., FSG members wear the hats of both an economist, and a financial strategist, allowing us to combine the two fields for the benefit of our clients. 

Please find below a list of projects that FSG has worked on at Salomon/Citi, Credit Suisse, and Ramirez and Co.
